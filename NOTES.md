### State Management

- Theme state managed through React Context

- Nested routes for better organization
- Dynamic routes for country details
- 404 handling for invalid routes

### 3. Data Fetching

- REST Countries API integration
- Error handling for API calls
- Loading states implementation
- Data caching strategy

### 4. Responsive Design

- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints:
  - Mobile: < 768px
  - Tablet: 768px - 1024px
  - Desktop: > 1024px
- Flexible grid system
- Responsive images
